# Contributing to Manshar
> Before you start working on a task, make sure it's assigned to you on the [issue tracker](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/n/projects/985678). You either assign it to yourself, or the project lead assigns it to you.

## Install the environment

The following steps will help you prepare your environment and get the project running on your local machine. However, if you just want to work on the front-end part of Manshar, you can reuse the existing dev backend `api-dev.manshar.com` and not have to install the whole backend and its dependencies including the database. Please refer to the wiki page [Contributing to Web Client](https://github.com/manshar/manshar/wiki/Contributing-to-Web-Client) for more details.

### Install [Homebrew](http://brew.sh/) (OS X)

Homebrew is the best package manager out there for OS X.

```sh
ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.github.com/Homebrew/homebrew/go/install)"
```

### Install Ruby

We recommend you to use one of the Ruby version control. We mainly use Ruby 2.0.

#### Install rbenv a Ruby version manager (with Homebrew)

```sh
brew install openssl

brew install ruby-build

brew install rbenv # Follow the instructions after installing rbenv

brew install rbenv-gemset

brew install redis # Make sure to also run redis afterwards.
```

#### Install Ruby 2.0

```sh
rbenv install 2.0.0-p247
```

## HowTo add a feature to Manshar

> Before that, **\*try*** to have your repository synced.

Let's say you want to contribute to XYZ feature, for your local repository create a branch for this feature

```sh
# you are on master

git branch xyz

git checkout xyz
```

After implementing the feature and its test cases, push it to your github account

If your edits touch the web-client code, make sure to also run ```gulp``` to build the web-client. And make sure
it builds successfully without errors or jshints warnings (try to fix jshints warnings).


```sh
git add .

git commit -m "feature XYZ"

git push origin xyz
```

Then open a pull request so we get notified for the feature you've implemented.
